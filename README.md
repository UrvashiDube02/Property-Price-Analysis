# Property Price Analysis
 Logistics Sector

---

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to predict property prices using a dataset containing various features related to property characteristics. This includes attributes like lot size, building type, quality, condition, year built, and more. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict real estate values.

## Steps Executed
1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Loading datasets and understanding their structure and patterns.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and converting data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing datasets to find patterns, relationships, or anomalies.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on EDA insights.
5. **Model Building**: Constructing a predictive model using the training dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**: Assessing and refining the model's performance.
7. **Prediction on Test Dataset**: Applying the model to predict prices on the test dataset.
8. **Future Price Projection**: Extending the model to predict future property prices.

## Project Utility
This project is useful for stakeholders in the real estate market, including buyers, sellers, investors, and developers. It provides insights into the factors that influence property prices and helps in making informed decisions.

## Key Results and Insights
- **Quality as a Prime Factor**: Overall material and finish quality (OverallQual) significantly affect prices.
- **Importance of Size**: Larger properties (considering Total Area) tend to be valued higher.
- **Impact of Location**: Prices vary notably across neighbourhoods, indicating location significance.
- **Influence of Property Age**: Newer or recently remodelled properties fetch higher prices.
- **Model Performance**: A Linear Regression model, enhanced through feature engineering, effectively predicts house prices.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to access the datasets and code.
2. Install necessary Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sci-kit-learn`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the workflow and analysis.
4. Experiment by tweaking the models or trying new features based on the provided dataset.
